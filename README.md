patient health record, as the name suggests, this is a simple base CRUD version of what could be a full fledged public health record,
which can be access by any doctor anywhere.

There are three users on this system, 
  
  1) the doctor who is authorized by the admin and can view a patient's entire medical record by entering their ID
  2) the patient who can add, view, delete and update their medical records
  3)admin, who controls them all.
  
Being developed as a mini project.
